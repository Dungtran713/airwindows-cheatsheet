    Comments:
      "Console5 works through a channel plugin on every sound source, feeding at unity gain into the buss plugin which overrides the digital summing with Airwindows summing. This gives you more internal space, more depth, and with Console 4 it now has glue making the top-end more listenable. \n\nDO NOT hit it hard; tracks at -35lufs each are still too loud for it if it's used in a 50+ tracks session. Aim for -50lufs, then use a gain trim on the master buss to make-up the lost volume to help when mixing.\n\nDon't use any plugins after Console5Channel, nor before Console5Buss as this changes what they're doing and won't be able to work properly.\n\nWARNING: it eats up low end, so maybe don't use on bass and kicks. If you do use it on low-end-rich tracks, also send them to an auxiliary track with FATHOM FIVE on it, to help recover the low end. \n\nIf the newly-added low end distorts,\n1. create a mix buss with Console5Buss for everything but the FATHOM FIVE track.\n2.

    Comments:
      "So the bottom line here is simply usability: mix into this like it’s an analog mixing console that can be overstressed. You can still put full scale single tracks through there, losslessly, because that’s what any Console does. You can mix into it provided you don’t stress the buss too hard (or don’t mind the distortion you get). Gain stage before hitting the Channel plugins, one Console6Channel plugin on each sound source with unity gain through the mix structure into the Console6Buss plugin. If you need to slam stuff louder afterward you must do it AFTER the Console6Buss plugin, in whatever way you like. Console is always a digital Mix Buss without an EQ-style sound of its own, so if you want further color you need to use other plugins outside Console. If you’re daring or just curious you can use things between the plugins (‘inside’ Console) such as a DAW EQ, echoes, subtle reverb etc. If you choose wrongly, it’ll distort or be weird, and things like EQs will be much more sensitive than usual to boosts and cuts.\n\nWARNING: it eats up low end, so maybe don't use on bass and kicks. If you do use it on low-end-rich tracks, also send them to an auxiliary track with FATHOM FIVE on it, to help recover the low end. \n\nIf the newly-added low end distorts,\n1. create a mix buss with Console6Buss for everything but the FATHOM FIVE track.\n2.

    Comments:
      "You can approach compression duties from several directions with Logical. It has three distinct stages, and will entirely bypass stages it’s not using. It’ll go from 1/1 compression, up to 2/1 using just a single stage (for the utmost transparency): keep it below 2/1 ratio and use the threshold control to bring in the compression. This is a traditional 2-buss natural-sounding compression. From 2/1 to 4/1 ratio, you can get various behaviors and the two stages in use still sound very clean: the speed control will give you different kinds of ‘swing’ and spring-back out of the compression.\n\nThen as you pass 4/1 ratio and go off to a max of 16/1 (approximate, but that’s the basic idea) there’s a tone change, and as you get into crazy high ratios, Logical goes a little bonkers. This was NOT available in previous Logicals. The issue was, if you rely heavily on that final compression stage, things can get messy. You can push Logical until it’s nasty and so full of energy it’s forcing you to use the makeup gain to PAD the output, just to handle all the madness.",
